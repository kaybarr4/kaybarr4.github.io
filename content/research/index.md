## <span style="color:#1d4dad">**Current Research:**</span> <span style="font-family: Courier New">eurydice</span> and the HD 63433 system
High stellar activity from young active stars is currently a major obstacle when using the radial velocity method to detect exoplanets. An increasingly common method to model stellar noise in radial velocity measurements is through Gaussian Process regression. However, there is no standardized process for assessing the goodness of fit of these stellar activity models in the exoplanet community, which raises concerns about the possibility of overfitted models (see [Blunt et al. 2023](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/acde78)). As the search for exoplanets begins to focus on younger and more active stars, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the extent of overfitting on stellar activity models. 

<span style="font-family: Courier New">**[eurydice](https://eurydice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**</span> is an open-source Python package produced to perform cross-validation on stellar activity models. <span style="font-family: Courier New">**eurydice**</span> functions through conditioning a given model on a subset of radial velocity measurements and examining how well the trained model predicts new unseen data.

With <span style="font-family: Courier New">**eurydice**</span>, I am building a new joint fit of planetary parameters for three exoplanets around the young star system HD 63433 and updating previous stellar activity models. As HD 63433 will be the first use case of eurydice, working with this star system will also provide valuable insight into the next stages of development for <span style="font-family: Courier New">**eurydice.**</span> 

## <span style="color:#1d4dad">**Past:**</span> Koronis Family Asteroids, Pluto, and TESS follow-up at Wallace Observatory
During the summer of 2023, I worked at MIT's Wallace Observatory on a handful of projects. 

My primary project was investigating Pluto’s atmosphere and surface using photometry. Through collecting data from Wallace throughout multiple years, we are hoping to examine notable differences to Pluto’s light curves which can hint to changes in its atmospheric makeup.

I also worked on collecting Koronis Family asteroid light curves to determine their spin vectors and model shape. Two papers on [452 Hamiltonia](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MPBu...51..176S/abstract) and [5139 Rumoi](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MPBu...51....6S/abstract) were published in *The Minor Planet Bulletin*. I also helped develop and troubleshoot an automated observation program for TESS planet candidate follow-up with the Elliot 24-inch telescope.
